# About me

Project where I write about me and a little bit about my professional career.

Created using react + vite + typescript.

## How to run

### Use the correct version of node

I recommend using `nvm` to download the node version. The version number is in the `.nvmrc` file.

```bash
nvm use
```

### Run project

```bash
npm run dev
```

## Deploy new changes to production

```bash
npm run deploy
```
